# Governance + Protection Layer (Supreme Rules)

## 1) Legal Positioning (Non-negotiable)
We operate as an independent sourcing and advisory service.
We are NOT real estate brokers, do not represent the seller, do not provide legal advice, and do not negotiate or execute transactions on behalf of buyers or sellers.

**Required statement (must appear on landing + mandate + terms):**
> "We act solely as an independent sourcing and advisory service. We do not represent the seller, do not provide legal advice, and do not negotiate or execute transactions on behalf of buyers or sellers."

## 2) Contractual Payment Authority (Why we get paid)
The operator earns a **buyer-paid success fee** for sourcing/advisory value delivered.

**Payment rule:**
- If the buyer successfully acquires a property through our sourcing/advisory process, a success fee of **5% of the winning bid** becomes payable.
- No acquisition = no fee.

## 3) Operator Final Authority (Dispute Kill-Switch)
**Rule:**
> "The operator retains final authority to determine deal status, confirm outcomes, freeze payouts, and resolve disputes based on system logs, submitted evidence, and platform rules."

## 4) Objective Proof System (Anti-fraud)
A deal becomes CLOSED_PAID only when:
1) buyer is confirmed as winning bidder (external proof)
2) buyer confirms intent to proceed
3) operator verifies independently and approves

**Rule:**
> "Buyer self-confirmation alone is insufficient to trigger payment or commission."

## 5) Commission Enforcement
- Fee obligation starts at WON_PENDING_CLOSE and becomes payable only after operator verification.
- Failure to pay after verification is a material breach.

**Clause:**
> "Failure to pay the success fee after confirmation constitutes a material breach of agreement."

## 6) Referral Program (Internal Incentive Only)
Referrals are internal incentives and do not create partnership/employment/agency relationships.

**Rule:**
> "Referral rewards are internal incentive distributions and do not create a legal partnership, employment, or agency relationship."
