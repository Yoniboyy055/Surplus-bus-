# Adversarial UX/Workflow Stress Test - Round 1

| Exploit Scenario | How the Exploit Happens (Step-by-Step) | Impact (Confusion, Loss, Bottleneck, Social Eng.) | Minimal Fix (Guard, Confirmation, UX Constraint) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Buyer Criteria Stale-Mating** | Buyer submits extremely broad or vague criteria (e.g., "Any property, any location, $1-$1B"). The matching engine returns thousands of low-confidence matches, burying the few good ones. | **Operational Bottleneck:** Operator wastes time manually filtering/rejecting low-quality matches, delaying qualification of serious deals. | **UX Constraint:** Implement mandatory minimum criteria fields (e.g., must select 1 property type AND define a max price) and a **Criteria Quality Score** displayed to the buyer. |
| **2. Referrer Social Engineering** | A referrer, seeing a deal status as `OFFER_SENT`, contacts the buyer directly (outside the platform) and pressures them to commit quickly, potentially bypassing the operator's guidance or mandate. | **Social Engineering / Operational Bottleneck:** Bypasses operator authority, creates an un-audited communication channel, and risks buyer dissatisfaction. | **UX Constraint (Referrer Portal):** For deals in `OFFER_SENT` or `EXCLUSIVE_WINDOW_ACTIVE`, replace the status with a generic, non-urgent message like "Deal is in active review." Only show terminal statuses. |
| **3. Operator Dashboard Overload** | The Operator Dashboard displays all deals in a single Kanban view. With 100+ deals, the board becomes unusable, making it impossible to quickly identify deals in critical states (e.g., `NEW_SUBMISSION`, `EXCLUSIVE_WINDOW_ACTIVE`). | **Operational Bottleneck / Revenue Loss:** Critical deals are missed, leading to expired exclusive windows and lost success fees. | **UX Guard (Operator Portal):** Implement a default filter to show only **Action Required** statuses (`NEW_SUBMISSION`, `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION`, `WON_PENDING_CLOSE`) upon login. |
| **4. Buyer Commitment Ambiguity** | A buyer clicks "Commit to Bid" on the Buyer Portal. The system updates the status to `BUYER_COMMITTED` but does not require a final confirmation or a clear next step (e.g., "Upload Proof of Funds"). | **Confusion / Revenue Loss:** Buyer assumes commitment is final, but fails to complete the necessary steps for a valid bid, causing the deal to fail. | **Confirmation Guard (Buyer Portal):** Implement a modal confirmation on "Commit to Bid" that clearly states: "By confirming, you agree to the 5% success fee and must upload Proof of Funds within 4 hours." |
| **5. Unaudited Payout Status Change** | The Operator Portal allows the operator to mark a payout as `paid` (changing `payouts.status` from 'pending' to 'paid') without requiring a confirmation or logging the action in the `audit_logs`. | **Operational Bottleneck / Confusion:** No clear audit trail for the financial transaction, leading to disputes with referrers and internal confusion during reconciliation. | **Server-Side Guard (API Route):** Enforce that the API call to update `payouts.status` requires a mandatory `internal_note` parameter and automatically logs an `audit_logs` entry with `action='PAYOUT_PROCESSED'`. |
