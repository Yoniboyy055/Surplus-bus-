# Buyer Mandate (Text to show before you work)

## Required Statements
1) Advisory Positioning:
"We act solely as an independent sourcing and advisory service. We do not represent the seller, do not provide legal advice, and do not negotiate or execute transactions on behalf of buyers or sellers."

2) Success Fee:
"If you successfully acquire a property through our sourcing/advisory process, a success fee of **5% of the winning bid** becomes payable. No acquisition = no fee."

3) Proof + Operator Verification:
"A deal is considered Closed & Paid only after external proof of winning is provided and the operator independently verifies and approves. Buyer self-confirmation alone is insufficient."

4) Referral:
"Referral rewards are paid from our success fee and do not change the amount you pay."

5) Disputes:
"In case of dispute, misuse, or fraud, the operator may freeze payouts and make the final determination based on platform rules, evidence, and audit logs."

## Buyer Confirmation Checkbox Text
"I understand the success fee, verification requirements, and governance rules, and I agree to proceed under these terms."
