# Decisions Locked (Non-negotiable)

## Fee Model (Government/Public Surplus Reality)
- Seller is government/court/municipality and does not pay commissions.
- Buyer pays the success fee only if they win and proceed.

## Success Fee
- Total success fee: **5% of the winning bid** (buyer-paid).
- No win = no fee.

## Referral Split (from the 5% fee)
- Starter: 20% of fee pool = 1.0% of deal value
- Proven: 25% of fee pool = 1.25% of deal value
- Elite: 30% of fee pool = 1.5% of deal value
Operator keeps remainder.

## Referral Attribution
- Single-level attribution (last-touch wins).
- No chain split. No multi-level.

## Urgency
- Exclusive window default = 72 hours.
- Reset cap = 3 per deal.
- After cap: downgrade buyer to Track B + reputation penalty.

## Key States (must exist)
- ON_HOLD
- OFFER_VIEWED
- CLOSED_PAID means: verified close + funds received

## Privacy Boundaries
- Referrer sees ONLY: tier/points + list of their deals with status only.
- Referrer must NEVER see buyer identity, buyer contact, offers, property details, internal notes.
- Buyer must NEVER see referrer identity.

## Auth
- Email magic link (no passwords).
- Buyers can submit without login; account can be created after submission.
- Phone number is contact only, not login.

## Disputes
- Operator may freeze payouts and decide outcomes using audit logs and evidence.
