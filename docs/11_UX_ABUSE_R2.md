# Adversarial UX/Workflow Stress Test - Round 2

| Exploit Scenario | How the Exploit Happens (Step-by-Step) | Impact (Confusion, Loss, Bottleneck, Social Eng.) | Minimal Fix (Guard, Confirmation, UX Constraint) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Referrer Tier Misalignment** | A referrer is downgraded from 'Elite' to 'Starter' due to a long period of inactivity. They log into the Referrer Portal and see their old, higher commission rate (30%) displayed prominently, causing them to believe they are entitled to a higher payout on their next deal. | **Confusion / Social Engineering:** Referrer is confused and potentially disputes the lower commission rate, leading to support overhead and possible social engineering attempts on the operator. | **UX Constraint (Referrer Portal):** Display the commission rate as a dynamic value derived from the current `tier` but also show a small, historical note: "Rate is based on current tier. See Tier History for changes." |
| **2. Buyer Reputation Score Misinterpretation** | The Buyer Portal displays the `reputation_score` (e.g., 50/100) but provides no context on what a "good" or "bad" score means, or how it affects their experience (e.g., Track A vs. B). | **Confusion / Operational Bottleneck:** Buyers constantly message the operator asking how to improve their score or what the score means, diverting operator time. | **UX Guard (Buyer Portal):** Add a tooltip or small info box next to the score explaining: "Score < 20 = Track B (Slower Deals). Score > 80 = Priority Matching." |
| **3. Operator "Needs Info" Stalling** | An operator, overwhelmed with new submissions, sets a deal status to `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` but fails to send a message to the buyer explaining *what* information is needed. | **Operational Bottleneck / Confusion:** Deal is stalled indefinitely, buyer is confused, and the operator has created a backlog of uncommunicated tasks. | **Server-Side Guard (API Route):** Enforce that the API call to set `deals.status` to `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` must be accompanied by a mandatory `messages` entry from the operator to the buyer. |
| **4. Inconsistent Deal ID Masking** | The Referrer Portal shows a masked deal ID (to protect buyer privacy), but the Operator Portal uses the full UUID. If the operator communicates the full UUID to the referrer (e.g., in an email), the referrer can bypass the masking logic. | **Social Engineering / Privacy Breach:** Referrer gains access to the full deal ID, potentially allowing them to track the deal through other means or link it to a specific buyer. | **UX Constraint (Operator Portal):** Implement a "Shareable ID" feature that generates a short, non-UUID, temporary ID for external communication, ensuring the full UUID is never shared outside the Operator Portal. |
| **5. Matching Engine "Black Box" Trust Issue** | The matching engine provides a "Match Confidence Score" but no explanation of *why* the score is high or low (e.g., "95% match because location is exact, but property type is secondary"). | **Confusion / Operational Bottleneck:** Operator distrusts the score and manually re-verifies every match, defeating the purpose of the automation. | **UX Guard (Operator Portal):** When displaying the Match Confidence Score, require the system to also display the **Top 3 Match Factors** (e.g., "Location: +40 points, Price Range: +30 points, Property Type: -10 points"). |
